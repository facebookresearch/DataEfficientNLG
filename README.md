## Data

Datasets for **Time**, **Alarm**, and **Reminder** domains is included.
**Weather** domain data can be found at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/TreeNLG .

Each response was collected by providing annotators, who are native English speakers, with a *user query*, and a *compositional meaning representation* (with discourse relations and dialog acts). All of these are made available in our dataset. See our linked paper for more details.
